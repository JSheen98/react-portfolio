# React Portfolio

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description:

With this project, I wanted to build a new portfolio with a professional clean look, while displaying the information associated with me and my career as a web developer so far. React is the front-end JavaScript library I used for this project. While building this project, I gained a better understanding of React, as well as solidified my understanding of frontend development, all while creating a portfolio to be proud of.
